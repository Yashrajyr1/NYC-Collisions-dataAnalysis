# 🧾 Project Description
This project analyzes motor vehicle collision data from New York City to uncover trends, identify dangerous locations, and understand contributing factors behind traffic accidents. 
Using publicly available data from NYC Open Data, the project leverages data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization techniques to provide actionable insights into traffic safety.

## 🎯Objectives
## The project helps answer questions such as:
*Which boroughs have the highest number of collisions?
*What are the top contributing factors to accidents?
*What time of day or year do collisions peak?
*How many people are injured or killed in these collisions?
*Are pedestrians, cyclists, or motorists more frequently affected?


## 📈 Sample Visualizations
- Bar chart: Accidents by borough
- Heatmap: Collision density by latitude/longitude
- Time series: Monthly trend of injuries
- Pie chart: Injury distribution by road users
- Horizontal bar: Top 10 contributing factors


## 📌 Future Improvements
- Predictive modeling (e.g., time series forecasting)
- Dashboards using Power BI/Tableau/Streamlit
- Integration with weather and traffic data


## ✅ How to Use
1. Clone this repo.
2. Install required libraries
