🚨🚨 NYC Collisions Analysis Project
  Welcome to the New York City Collisions Analysis project! 🗽📊
  
This end-to-end data analysis project explores traffic accidents across NYC, aiming to uncover patterns, identify high-risk zones, and provide actionable insights to improve road safety and urban planning.
By analyzing real-world collision data, this project highlights critical factors such as contributing causes, vehicle types, injuries/fatalities, and geographical distribution across boroughs. 🗺️

🎯🎯 Project Objectives
  📍 Identify accident hotspots across NYC
  🚗 Analyze vehicle types involved in frequent collisions
  👥 Examine injuries and fatalities by borough and time
  📅 Discover temporal patterns (peak days, months, hours)
  📈 Provide visual dashboards for quick insights
  ✅ Help city officials, planners, and citizens understand collision risks

🛠️🛠️ Tools & Technologies
  🐍 Python – Pandas, NumPy for data analysis
  📊 Matplotlib / Seaborn / Plotly – Visualizations
  🧮 EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) – Pattern recognition
  🌐 GeoPandas / Folium – Mapping collisions
  🗃️ SQL – Querying large datasets
  📈 Tableau / Power BI – Interactive dashboards
